* Start thinking for project ideas. See 1 [below](#footnotes).

#### 24/06/2017

* Brush up on C and C++. See 2 [below](#footnotes).  
* Start working on project.

## July

#### 22/07/2017

  Start with Eudyptula Challenge. See 4 [below](#footnotes).

## August

#### 05/08/2017

* Get settled in. First meet after vacations!  
* Start with UC Berkeley CS 162. See 5 [below](#footnotes).

## Footnotes
1. A project can be anything about operating systems, from a simple Bash script, to a new kernel in C! Just make sure that it does solve some real problem, whether it is a personal problem or some problem faced by the general public.

2. Most of us, including students of Batch of 2020, will be pretty familiar with C by the end of semester. Furthermore, students of Batch of 2018 and 2019 will be familiar with C++ as well. Go over your weak concepts, discussing in the forums, and/or using the following MOOCs:

         * CS50 on edX.
         * C++: A General Purpose Language and Library Jump Start on MVA.
         * Introduction to C++ on edX.
         * Intermediate C++ on edX.

3. By this point of time, we all would have a list of projects we can contribute to, as well as be comfortable with C, C++ and Bash. Consequently, we can start going through those projects' documentation and bugs and start contributing.

4. Eudyptula Challenge aims at teaching you Linux kernel from scratch through a series of challenges, wherein you actually write and modify Linux kernel code. [Here][eudyptula-link] is the link.

5. This course is mainly intended for students of Batch of 2020. Students of Batch of 2018 and 2019 may want to use this course to brush on OS concepts if they are working on the Eudyptula Challenge (see 4 [above](#footnotes)).
